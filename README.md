### Inspiration

On Thursday, Febuary 22, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. The invasion wreaked havoc on the civilians and many lost their homes, lives, and loved ones. Depsite the invasion, Ukraine has not lost hope and continues fighting.

This project was created in support on Ukraine. We wanted to create an application where the rest of the world could reach out and provide support to people directly within Ukraine. This chat application application allows users in Ukraine to communicate with the rest of the world and the rest of the world to communicate with Ukraine.

This software connects those who need support and those who are generous enough to provide it.

### What is does

Our chat application allows the rest of the world to communicate with people in Ukraine. When a user is loaded in, they create an account specifying their username, password, and location (through the navigator.geolocation function and google maps api).

The user is then directed to the chat application where they have options to add friends and chat with people in Ukraine or the rest of the world depending on where they reside.

Users outside of Ukraine have options to donate to the person they are speaking with.

### Contribution

#### David Fong

    I was the project lead. I worked on building out the backend, designing the architecture of
    the frontend, and assisted my teamates wherever needed.

    I learned a lot about various backend technologies like socket.io, node.js, and express, mongoDB.

#### Justin Tran

    I worked on building the frontend portion of the project for the login and messaging page using
    React Javascript, HTML and CSS. I also worked on integrating the functionality from the backend to reflect
    it on the frontend by updating the views and incorporating interactive UIs for the user.

    Overall, I developed my understanding of React JS and reinforced my skills for HTML and CSS.

#### Veevek Dave

    I worked as a front-end developer for this project. I was reponsible for creating Create-Account page and 
    the message component which was used in the messaging page. I utlized React.js and CSS to build these pages.
    I also assisted the members in my Team whenever they needed help or were stuck.
    
    Through this experience, I learned how to impliment React.js, but more importantly learned how to work in team 
    and communicate effectivly through using tools like Git, Figma, and daily "stand-ups". Thanks to David for this
    great learning oppurtunity.
    
#### Tashi Sherpa

    I was a frontend developer for this project. I worked on the landing page the donation design and functionality,
    and the media queries for pages to ensure a responsive user interface for all screen sizes.
    To carry out these tasks, I used React.js, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

    I would say that this journey really helped me learn and develop my skills with React.js and Git as well as
    solidify and reinforce my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### How to test

1. Clone the project and open both start both servers -or- click the project link

2. Open up two instances of the website

3. Sign in with --> username: david, password: davidpassword

4. Sign in with --> username: gabby, password: gabbypassword

5. Click the add friend icon on both sites.

6. Message each other

Gabby is located in "Ukraine" and David is located in "New York". In order for users to be connected one of the them has to be in Ukraine and one outside of Ukraine.

### Tech Stack (MERN)

We used Mongodb, Express, React, and Node.js to build out this application. We also used socket.io for messaging between users.
